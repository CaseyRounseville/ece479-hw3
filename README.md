# ECE 479 Homework 3
Please encode the A* algorithm in C, C++, or a language that we can compile and run 
to investigate the power of heuristics for the A* algorithm using the 8 puzzle 
problem.  Use any two heuristics you may research or invent your own heuristics as 
long as they guarantee the solution optimality. In your write up, please explain how 
those two heuristics compare, and clearly state comparison criteria with respect to 
their efficiency of finding the optimal solutions.
